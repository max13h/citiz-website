## About the Project

This is a personal project to redesign the Citiz website, created to showcase my skills as a web developer. Built with **React**, it’s my first project using the framework and was completed in about 20 hours.  

### Key Details
- **Single Page**: Only the root page is included, without additional pages from the original site.  
- **No Responsiveness**: The layout is optimized for desktop only.  
- **Deployment**: Hosted using **GitHub Pages** with an automated pipeline via **GitHub Actions**.
